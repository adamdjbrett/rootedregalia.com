about:
 title: "Background"
 text: "Rooted Regalia offers an alternative to graduation apparel made from synthetic fabric. Earning a degree takes years of thoughtful work. But commemorating achievements wrapped in disposal, single-use plastic does not make sense . To celebrate an educational accomplishment, it is important to have a garment that supports the values of sustainability, rather than making the world's problems worse. Many firms sell regalia at fast-fashion prices. While our products have higher initial costs than many, they are sustainably produced: we use fabric made from plant fibers, such as hemp, and the labor for sewing the robes is provided by fairly paid workers in US, rather than prison labor or off-shore sourcing."
